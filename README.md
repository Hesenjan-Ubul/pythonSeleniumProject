# Python Selenium Test Automation Framework

This repository contains a test automation framework written in Python, using pytest, Selenium, and the Page Object Model (POM) for web page abstraction, targeting the Mahara.org web application as example Web App.

## Overview

This framework is designed to automate UI tests for web applications. It leverages the following technologies:

- **Python**: A powerful programming language for writing test scripts and automation.
  
- **pytest**: A testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.

- **Selenium**: A web automation tool that allows you to interact with web elements and simulate user actions.

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern that abstracts web pages into objects, making test scripts more readable, maintainable, and reusable.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: The framework is organized into modules for easy maintenance and scalability.

- **Page Objects**: Web pages are represented as objects, making tests more readable and maintainable.

- **Fixture Management**: pytest fixtures are used to set up and tear down test environments.

- **Reporting**: Test results are automatically generated and can be viewed in various formats.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `https://github.com/Hesenjan-Ubul/pythonSeleniumProject.git`

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Configure WebDriver**: Set up the WebDriver for your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and update the configuration file if necessary.

4. **Write Test Cases**: Create test scripts using pytest and leverage the Page Object Model for better abstraction.

5. **Run Tests**: Execute test cases using pytest: `pytest`
